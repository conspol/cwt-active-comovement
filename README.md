 # CWT-based co-movement and active transport detection
 
This repository contains a workflow for detecting co-movement and active transport from 2D live-cell imaging data.

The project is an evolving and actively maintained toolset, with a goal to provide academic community 
(biologists in particular) with a self-contained tool to detect and analyze co-movement and active transport of objects from their 2D tracks.
